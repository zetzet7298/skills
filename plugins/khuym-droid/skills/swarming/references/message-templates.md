# Agent Mail Message Templates

Standard message formats for swarm coordination. All messages post to the epic thread (`thread_id=<EPIC_ID>`) unless noted otherwise.
Use a shared epic topic tag in all messages (recommended: `topic="epic-<EPIC_ID>"`).
Use `<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>` for the coordinator identity, and keep it a valid Agent Mail adjective+noun name.

## 1. Spawn Notification

**Posted by:** Swarm coordinator (`<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>`)  
**When:** After Agent Mail setup is complete, before spawning workers
**Purpose:** Announces the swarm start and the self-routing execution model

Runtime call:
`send_message(project_key=..., sender_name="<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>", to=["<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>"], thread_id="<EPIC_ID>", topic="epic-<EPIC_ID>", ...)`

```
Subject: [SWARM START] <feature-name>
Thread: <EPIC_ID>
Topic: epic-<EPIC_ID>
Importance: NORMAL

Swarm initialized for epic <EPIC_ID>.

Execution model:
- Workers are self-routing via `bv --robot-priority`
- File coordination happens through Agent Mail reservations
- Blockers and course corrections happen in this thread

Workers spawning now:
- Worker: <WORKER_RUNTIME_NAME_1> / Agent Mail: pending
- Worker: <WORKER_RUNTIME_NAME_2> / Agent Mail: pending
- Worker: <WORKER_RUNTIME_NAME_3> / Agent Mail: pending

All workers: join this thread, post startup acknowledgment, then load the khuym:executing skill.
Coordinator: do not idle after this message. Keep polling `fetch_inbox(...)` and `fetch_topic(...)` until the swarm is complete.
```

Description:
<Clear description of what is blocking. Include errors, file names, and relevant details.>

What I need to proceed:
<Specific ask: information, release of a file reservation, user decision, etc.>

I am paused on this bead and waiting for a reply on this thread.
Until a reply arrives, I will keep polling `fetch_inbox(...)` on this topic.

## 5. File Conflict Request

**Posted by:** Worker  
**When:** Worker needs a file another worker currently holds
**Purpose:** Coordinates file access without preassigned worker scopes

File conflict:
- Worker runtime name: <WORKER_RUNTIME_NAME>
- Agent Mail name: <AGENT_MAIL_NAME>
- Needs a file that is currently reserved.

Requested file: <path/to/file>
Currently reserved by: <AGENT_NAME_holder or "unknown">
My bead: <bead-id>
Reason needed: <Why this file is required for this bead>

Awaiting orchestrator decision:
1. Request holder release at a safe checkpoint
2. Ask me to wait
3. Ask me to defer and create a follow-up bead

Until a decision arrives, I will keep polling `fetch_inbox(...)` on this topic.

<AGENT_NAME_requester>: stand by until release is confirmed.

OPTION C — Defer:
<AGENT_NAME_requester>: defer this change. Create a follow-up bead and continue with the next executable bead.

Subject: [OVERSEER] Startup acknowledgment missing
Thread: <EPIC_ID>
Topic: epic-<EPIC_ID>
Importance: HIGH

You were spawned for epic <EPIC_ID>, but you have not posted your startup acknowledgment yet.

Do this now, in order:
1. Re-read `AGENTS.md`
2. Post `[ONLINE]` with your Worker runtime name and Agent Mail name
3. Confirm `AGENTS.md: read`
4. Run `fetch_inbox(...)`
5. Only then continue into `bv --robot-priority`
```

## 9. Silent Worker Reminder

**Posted by:** Swarm coordinator (`<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>`)
**When:** An active worker has gone quiet for 3 poll cycles

Runtime call:
`send_message(project_key=..., sender_name="<COORDINATOR_AGENT_NAME>", to=["<AGENT_MAIL_NAME>"], thread_id="<EPIC_ID>", topic="epic-<EPIC_ID>", ...)`

Subject: [OVERSEER] Status update required
Thread: <EPIC_ID>
Topic: epic-<EPIC_ID>
Importance: HIGH

You have gone quiet while the swarm is still active.

Reply on this thread with one of:
- `[DONE] <bead-id>` if the bead is complete
- `[BLOCKED] <bead-id>` if you need help
- `[FILE CONFLICT] <path>` if you are waiting on a reservation
- `Status: still working on <bead-id>` if you are actively progressing

Before replying, re-read `AGENTS.md` if you compacted or drifted, then run `fetch_inbox(...)`.
```
