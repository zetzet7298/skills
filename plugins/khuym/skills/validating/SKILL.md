  The critical gate between planning and execution in the khuym ecosystem. Load this skill after planning completes and before swarming begins. Verifies the phase contract, story map, and bead graph across 8 structural dimensions, executes time-boxed spikes for HIGH-risk items, polishes beads with bv graph analytics, and requires explicit user approval before any code is written. Prevents executing unclear phases, malformed story breakdowns, unknown blockers, and redundant duplicate work.

# Validating

If `.khuym/onboarding.json` is missing or stale for the current repo, stop and invoke `khuym:using-khuym` before continuing.

## Why This Skill Exists

The most expensive failure in agentic delivery is not a buggy bead. It is launching execution against a phase that was never clear enough to deserve execution.

Khuym now treats a phase as a **small closed loop**:

- clear entry state
- clear exit state
- simple demo story
- stories that explain why the internal order makes sense
- beads that implement those stories

This skill verifies all of that. It is not enough for the bead graph to look tidy. The validator must be able to answer:

- Does this phase close a meaningful loop?
- If all stories finish, will the exit state be true?
- If all beads finish, will the stories actually be complete?
- If the phase fails, will we know whether to debug locally or pivot the larger plan?

Skipping validating is still the fastest path to expensive rework.

## Prerequisites

You need all of these:

- `history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md`
- `history/<feature>/discovery.md`
- `history/<feature>/approach.md`
- `history/<feature>/phase-contract.md`
- `history/<feature>/story-map.md`
- `.beads/` for this epic

If any are missing, stop and return to `khuym:planning`.

## Phase 1: Structural Verification

**Maximum 3 iterations. Nothing advances until this passes.**

### Step 1.1 — Spawn plan-checker

Load `references/plan-checker-prompt.md`. Spawn an isolated subagent with:

```text
Inputs:
- all .beads/*.md for this epic
- history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md
- history/<feature>/discovery.md
- history/<feature>/approach.md
- history/<feature>/phase-contract.md
- history/<feature>/story-map.md
Role: plan-checker
```

The plan-checker verifies 8 dimensions:

1. **Phase contract clarity** — clear entry state, exit state, demo, unlocks
2. **Story coverage and ordering** — each story has a job and the order makes sense
3. **Decision coverage** — locked decisions from `CONTEXT.md` map to stories and beads
4. **Dependency correctness** — graph is valid and acyclic
5. **File scope isolation** — parallel-ready beads do not silently collide
6. **Context budget** — each bead fits in one worker context
7. **Verification completeness** — stories and beads have explicit done/verify criteria
8. **Exit-state completeness and risk alignment** — if everything finishes, the phase really reaches its exit state and HIGH-risk items are spiked

### Step 1.2 — Triage results

**If all 8 dimensions PASS:** proceed to Phase 2.

**If any dimension FAILS:**

1. Fix the specific issue in the relevant artifact
2. Re-run the checker
3. Count that as the next iteration

### Repair routing

- Phase contract unclear -> revise `phase-contract.md`
- Story order or story scope unclear -> revise `story-map.md`
- Decision/gap issue -> revise story map and/or beads
- Dependency/scope/test issue -> revise beads
- Exit state not convincingly reachable -> revise contract, story map, or approach

After 3 iterations with any FAIL still present:

- stop
- escalate to the user
- explain which dimension is still failing and why

Do not attempt iteration 4.

---

## Phase 2: Spike Execution

Run this for every HIGH-risk component from `approach.md`.

If no HIGH-risk items exist, skip to Phase 3.

### Step 2.1 — Create spike beads

```bash
br create "Spike: <specific yes/no question>" -t task -p 0
```

### Step 2.2 — Execute spikes in isolation

For each spike:

1. Spawn an isolated subagent
2. Hard time-box: 30 minutes
3. Write findings to `.spikes/<feature>/<spike-id>/FINDINGS.md`
4. Close with a definitive YES or NO

```bash
br close <id> --reason "YES: <validated approach and constraints>"
# or
br close <id> --reason "NO: <blocker and why it breaks the approach>"
```

### Step 2.3 — Act on spike results

**If YES:**

- embed the spike findings into affected beads
- update `story-map.md` if the story now has tighter constraints

**If NO:**

- full stop
- write blocker summary into `approach.md`
- return to `khuym:planning`
- re-run validating from Phase 1 after replanning

---

## Phase 3: Bead Polishing

Multiple rounds. Quality compounds here.

### Round 1: Dependency completeness

```bash
bv --robot-suggest
```

If real structural dependencies are missing, add them and re-run.

### Round 2: Graph health

```bash
bv --robot-insights
```

Fix cycles, bottlenecks, disconnected work, and orphaned beads. Re-run if critical findings remain.

### Round 3: Priority sanity

```bash
bv --robot-priority
```

Adjust priorities if the graph says foundational work is buried.

### Deduplication

Read all bead titles and descriptions:

- same story + same file scope + same goal -> likely duplicate
- same outcome expressed as two different beads -> merge or close redundant work

### Fresh-eyes review

Load `references/bead-reviewer-prompt.md` and spawn a subagent with the full bead set.

Fix all CRITICAL flags before moving on. MINOR flags are judgment calls but should be considered carefully.

### Story-to-bead coherence check

Before leaving Phase 3, inspect `history/<feature>/story-map.md`:

- every story should map to at least one bead
- every bead should belong to a story
- if a story has too many beads, it may be too large
- if a bead spans multiple unrelated stories, the decomposition is muddy

---

## Phase 4: Exit-State Readiness Review

This is the human-readable readiness check before approval.

Ask these questions explicitly:

1. If all stories reach "Done Looks Like", does the phase exit state hold?
2. If all beads close successfully, will all stories actually be done?
3. Is the phase demo story now credible?
4. Does this phase still make sense in the larger whole plan?

If any answer is "no" or "not sure", do not approve execution. Route back:

- phase meaning problem -> `phase-contract.md`
- story decomposition problem -> `story-map.md`
- implementation granularity problem -> `.beads/`
- architecture/risk problem -> `approach.md` and maybe replanning

---

## Phase 5: Final Approval Gate

**This gate is non-negotiable.**

Present a structured summary:

```text
VALIDATION COMPLETE — APPROVAL REQUIRED BEFORE EXECUTION

Phase Summary:
- Phase: <name>
- Stories: <N>
- Beads: <N>
- Demo story: <one line>

Structural Verification:
- All 8 dimensions: PASS (after <N> iterations)

Spike Results:
- HIGH-risk items: <N>
- Result: <all passed / concerns listed>

Polishing Results:
- Dependencies added: <N>
- Graph issues fixed: <N>
- Priority adjustments: <N>
- Duplicates removed: <N>
- Fresh-eyes CRITICAL flags fixed: <N>

Exit-State Readiness:
- Entry state understood: YES
- Exit state observable: YES
- Story sequence coherent: YES
- Demo credible: YES

Unresolved concerns:
- <none | list>

Approve execution for this phase? (yes/no)
```

### If user approves

Update `.khuym/STATE.md`:

```text
PHASE: validated
FEATURE: <feature-name>
VALIDATED_AT: <timestamp>
STORIES: <N>
BEADS: <N>
```

Handoff:

`Validation complete. Phase contract, story map, and beads all pass. Invoke khuym:swarming skill.`

### If user rejects

Ask what concerns them specifically and route back:

1. phase meaning / exit state problem
2. story order or story size problem
3. risk/spike concern
4. bead quality problem
5. fundamental approach problem

Do not guess.

---

## Lightweight Mode

For confirmed LOW-risk single-story, single-bead work:

1. abbreviated structural verification on the single story/bead
2. skip spikes
3. run `bv --robot-suggest`
4. still require the final approval gate

If uncertain, use full mode.

---

## Red Flags

- executing any bead before approval
- validating a bead set that has no phase contract
- validating a story map that cannot explain "why now" for Story 1
- a phase exit state that is not observable
- a spike returned NO and execution is still being considered
- iteration 4 of structural verification
- a bead's "done" does not clearly connect to any story
- a story that cannot answer "what does this unlock?"
