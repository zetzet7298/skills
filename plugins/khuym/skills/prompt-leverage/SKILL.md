name: prompt-leverage
description: Strengthen a raw user prompt into an execution-ready instruction set for Codex or another AI agent. Use when the user wants to improve an existing prompt, build a reusable prompting framework, wrap the current request with better structure, add clearer tool rules, or create a hook that upgrades prompts before execution.

# Prompt Leverage

If `.khuym/onboarding.json` is missing or stale for the current repo, stop and invoke `khuym:using-khuym` before continuing.

Turn the user's current prompt into a stronger working prompt without changing the underlying intent. Preserve the task, fill in missing execution structure, and add only enough scaffolding to improve reliability.

## Workflow

1. Read the raw prompt and identify the real job to be done.
2. Infer the task type: coding, research, writing, analysis, planning, or review.
3. Rebuild the prompt with the framework blocks in `references/framework.md`.
4. Keep the result proportional: do not over-specify a simple task.
5. Return both the improved prompt and a short explanation of what changed when useful.

## Transformation Rules

- Preserve the user's objective, constraints, and tone unless they conflict.
- Prefer adding missing structure over rewriting everything stylistically.
- Add context requirements only when they improve correctness.
- Add tool rules only when tool use materially affects correctness.
- Add verification and completion criteria for non-trivial tasks.
- Keep prompts compact enough to be practical in repeated use.

## Framework Blocks

Use these blocks selectively.

- `Objective`: state the task and what success looks like.
- `Context`: list sources, files, constraints, and unknowns.
- `Work Style`: set depth, breadth, care, and first-principles expectations.
- `Tool Rules`: state when tools, browsing, or file inspection are required.
- `Output Contract`: define structure, formatting, and level of detail.
- `Verification`: require checks for correctness, edge cases, and better alternatives.
- `Done Criteria`: define when the agent should stop.

## Output Modes

Choose one mode based on the user request.

- `Inline upgrade`: provide the upgraded prompt only.
- `Upgrade + rationale`: provide the prompt plus a brief list of improvements.
- `Template extraction`: convert the prompt into a reusable fill-in-the-blank template.
- `Hook spec`: explain how to apply the framework automatically before execution.

## Hook Pattern

When the user asks for a hook, model it as a pre-processing layer:

1. Accept the current prompt.
2. Classify the task and risk level.
3. Expand the prompt using the framework blocks.
4. Return the upgraded prompt for execution.
5. Optionally keep a diff or summary of injected structure.

Use `scripts/augment_prompt.py` when a deterministic first-pass rewrite is helpful.

## Quality Bar

Before finalizing, check the upgraded prompt:

- still matches the original intent
- does not add unnecessary ceremony
- includes the right verification level for the task
- gives the agent a clear definition of done

If the prompt is already strong, say so and make only minimal edits.
