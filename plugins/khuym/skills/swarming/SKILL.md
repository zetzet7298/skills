name: swarming
description: Use when the khuym:validating skill approves the current phase for execution and parallel worker agents should run. Initializes the overseer/orchestrator context, spawns bounded Codex subagents, monitors worker results plus local file reservations, coordinates rescues and course corrections through the parent thread, and hands off either to planning for the next phase or to reviewing after the final phase. The orchestrator TENDS — it never implements beads directly.

# Swarming

If `.khuym/onboarding.json` is missing or stale for the current repo, stop and invoke `khuym:using-khuym` before continuing.

You are the orchestrator. Launch workers, monitor coordination, handle escalations, and keep the swarm moving. Do not implement beads directly; spawned workers use `khuym:executing`.

## Coordination Substrate

Same-session swarming uses:

- beads and `bv` for work selection and graph state
- Codex subagents for bounded parallel execution
- `.khuym/reservations.json` for local file ownership
- the parent Codex thread for `[DONE]`, `[BLOCKED]`, `[HANDOFF]`, and `[NOOP]` results

No external mail server is required for the default path.

## When to Use

Invoke after `khuym:validating` says: `Validation complete. Current phase passes. Invoke khuym:swarming skill.`

Prerequisites:

- current-phase beads are approved and open
- `EPIC_ID` is known
- `node .codex/khuym_status.mjs --json` has been run when available
- `history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` has been read when present

## Operating Contract

1. Confirm readiness with `bv --robot-triage --graph-root <EPIC_ID>`.
2. Sweep expired reservations.
3. Spawn bounded worker subagents with `references/worker-template.md`.
4. Record `agent_id`, `agent_nickname`, bead, and status in `.khuym/state.json`.
5. Tend the live graph, reservations, and worker results until the phase is clean.
6. Write `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` before pausing near context limits.
7. Run final graph, reservation, and quality checks before handing off.

Load `references/swarming-protocol.md` for detailed spawn context, tend-loop rules, silence ladder, conflict resolution, handoff content, completion rules, and red flags.

## Hard Rules

- Never spawn workers before validation approves execution.
- Never let workers edit without local reservations.
- Do not resolve file conflicts by asking workers to be careful; adjust reservations or bead scope.
- Silence alone is not failure. Do not send routine mid-flight `send_input(...)` check-ins.
- Reserve interrupts for explicit user aborts or confirmed deadlocks where the user wants preemption.
- If context usage passes roughly 65%, write `.khuym/HANDOFF.json` and pause safely.

## Completion Signal

Swarming is complete when either:

- the current phase is executed and the workflow returns to planning for the next phase, or
- the final phase is executed and the user can be told: `Swarm execution complete for the final phase. Invoke khuym:reviewing.`
