# Reviewing

Post-execution quality verification. You are the last automated gate before a feature ships. Your job is to catch what escaped execution — not just confirm tasks are closed, but verify that the work is **correct, safe, and complete**.

Research confirms this is not optional: removing the verification agent degrades fix precision most sharply ([Multi-Agent Bug Detection, IJRASET 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135756/)). Multi-perspective review covers 7.8 dimensions vs. 1–3 for a single reviewer ([Hydra-Reviewer, IEEE TSE 2025](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203269/)).

## When to Invoke

- After `swarming` reports "All tracks complete"
- Manually: when spot-checking any branch or set of changes
- Flags: `--serial` (always serial), `--skip-uat` (auto mode only, skips Phase 3)

## Prerequisites

Read before starting:
- `history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md` — locked decisions (D1, D2...) and testable deliverables
- `history/<feature>/execution-plan.md` — tracks, beads, file scopes
- `.khuym/STATE.md` — current epic state

## Phase 1: Automated Review (5 Specialist Agents)

### Dispatch Rules

| Condition | Mode |
|-----------|------|
| ≤4 agents active | **Parallel** (default) |
| 5+ agents active | **Serial** (auto-switch — inform user) |
| `--serial` flag | Always serial |

With 5 agents, **auto-switch to serial mode** and tell the user: "Running review agents in serial mode (5 agents). Use --parallel to override."

### Agent Roster

Dispatch agents 1–4 first (parallel or serial per rules above). Agent 5 **always runs last** regardless of mode.

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1 `code-quality` | Simplicity, readability, DRY, error handling, type safety |
| 2 `architecture` | Design patterns, coupling, separation of concerns, API design |
| 3 `security` | OWASP top 10, injection, auth, secrets, data exposure |
| 4 `test-coverage` | Missing tests, edge cases, integration gaps |
| 5 `learnings-synthesizer` | **Always last** — cross-reference `history/learnings/`, flag known patterns, suggest compounding entries |

### Isolated Context Per Agent — CRITICAL

Each agent receives **only**:
1. The git diff (or worktree diff): `git diff <base>..<head>`
2. `history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md`
3. `history/<feature>/execution-plan.md`

Do **not** pass session history, implementation notes, or agent communication logs. Reviewer objectivity depends on seeing only the work product, not the implementer's thought process ([Superpowers code-reviewer pattern](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/main/skills/requesting-code-review/SKILL.md)).

See `references/review-agent-prompts.md` for the exact prompt for each agent.

### Finding Files

Each agent writes findings to `.khuym/findings/` using this naming convention:

```
{id}-pending-{p1|p2|p3}-{slug}.md
```

Examples:
```
001-pending-p1-sql-injection-in-search.md
002-pending-p2-missing-rate-limiting.md
003-pending-p3-unused-import-cleanup.md
```

See `references/finding-template.md` for the required format.

### Severity Rules

| Priority | Label | Criteria | Gate |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| **P1** | CRITICAL | Security vulns, data corruption, breaking changes | **Blocks merge — always** |
| **P2** | IMPORTANT | Performance, architecture, reliability | Should fix before merge |
| **P3** | NICE-TO-HAVE | Minor improvements, cleanup, docs | Record for future |

**Calibration rule:** Not everything is P1. Severity inflation wastes cycles and trains reviewers to ignore findings. When in doubt, P2.

### Synthesis (After All Agents Complete)

1. Collect all finding files from `.khuym/findings/`
2. Deduplicate overlapping issues (agent-native insight: mark as "duplicate of {id}")
3. Surface `learnings-synthesizer` matches with known-pattern links
4. Count: N P1, N P2, N P3
5. Present summary table to user

**If P1 findings exist:** HARD-GATE — stop and present. Do not proceed to Phase 2 until user acknowledges. Even in go mode, P1 is always human-gated.

## Phase 2: 3-Level Artifact Verification

Goal-backward check on every artifact named in `CONTEXT.md` and `execution-plan.md`. Task completion ≠ goal achievement — a file existing is not evidence the feature works.

Run this as a subagent with isolated context (diff + execution-plan.md only).

### The 3 Levels

**Level 1 — EXISTS:** Does the file/component/route exist?
```bash
# Check example
ls src/components/PaymentForm.tsx
```

**Level 2 — SUBSTANTIVE:** Is it real, not a stub?

Scan for anti-patterns:
```
return null / return {} / return []
Empty handlers: onClick={() => {}}
TODO / FIXME / PLACEHOLDER comments
console.log-only implementations
API routes returning static data without DB queries
Components with state that never renders state
```

**Level 3 — WIRED:** Is it imported and used in the integration layer?
```bash
# Check example
grep -r "PaymentForm" src/pages/ src/app/
```

### Reporting

For each artifact:
- ✅ L1+L2+L3: fully wired
- ⚠️ L1+L2 only: created but not integrated — create P2 finding
- 🛑 L1 only (stub): exists but empty — create P1 finding
- 🛑 Missing: not found — create P1 finding

## Phase 3: Human UAT

**Scope:** Walk the user through every testable deliverable from `CONTEXT.md`.

**Protocol:**
1. Extract all decisions with `SEE` (visual), `CALL` (API), or `RUN` (execution) verification from CONTEXT.md
2. For each deliverable, present: "Does [X] work as decided in [D-id]?"
3. Reference the exact decision ID so the user can verify against their original intent
4. One item at a time — HARD-GATE between each

**Example prompt:**
```
UAT Item 3 of 5 — Decision D4:
"Users can reset their password via email link (D4)."
Can you navigate to /forgot-password, enter an email, and confirm the reset email arrives?
[Pass / Fail / Skip]
```

**On failure:**
1. Invoke `debugging` skill → root-cause the failure
2. Create a fix bead: `br create "Fix: <description>" -t task -p 0 --parent <epic-id>`
3. Execute the fix bead (invoke `executing` skill)
4. Re-verify the specific UAT item
5. Do not proceed until the item passes or user explicitly accepts the failure

**On skip:** Record in `.khuym/STATE.md` with reason. Do not count as pass.

## Phase 4: Finishing

You are the last step before compounding. Close the loop completely.

### Checklist

```
[ ] All beads in epic are closed
    → bv --robot-triage --graph-root <epic-id>
    → Any open beads? Create final fix tasks or explicitly defer with br update --defer

[ ] Final build/test/lint passes
    → Run project's standard commands (npm test / pytest / cargo test / etc.)
    → If fails: create P1 finding, fix before continuing

[ ] Present merge options to user:
    1. Create PR (recommended)
    2. Merge directly
    3. Keep branch for further work
    4. Discard branch

[ ] Clean up worktree (if used)
    → git worktree remove .worktrees/<feature>

[ ] Close epic bead
    → br close <epic-id> --reason "Feature complete: <summary>"

[ ] Clear working state
    → Archive STATE.md: cp .khuym/STATE.md history/<feature>/STATE-final.md
    → Clear: echo "" > .khuym/STATE.md
```

### Merge Options Detail

**Create PR:**
```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<feature title>" \
  --body "## Summary\n<description>\n\n## Verified\n- [ ] All UAT items passed\n- [ ] No P1 findings\n- P2 findings: <list or 'none'>\n\n## Review Findings\nSee .khuym/findings/" \
  --draft  # remove if ready for immediate merge
```

**If P2 findings exist:** Include them in PR body. Recommend fixing before merge, but user decides.

**If P3 findings exist:** Add to PR body under "Future Work." Do not block merge.

## Handoff

After Phase 4 completes:

> "Feature complete. Epic [id] closed. [N] learnings flagged by learnings-synthesizer.
> Invoke `compounding` skill to capture patterns, decisions, and failures for future planning cycles."

Update `.khuym/STATE.md`:
```
STATUS: reviewing-complete
EPIC: <id>
HANDOFF: compounding
FLAGGED_LEARNINGS: <count> (see .khuym/findings/ for learnings-synthesizer output)
```

## Red Flags

Stop and surface to user immediately if you see:

- **P1 findings and no user acknowledgment** — never silently continue past P1
- **UAT failures marked as "pass"** — do not log a skip as a pass
- **Artifact verification skipped** — Phase 2 is not optional; stubs ship to production this way
- **Epic closed with open beads** — verify with `bv` before closing
- **`learnings-synthesizer` flagging a known failure pattern** — this means the team already hit this problem. Surface explicitly: "Known pattern from [date]: [link]"
- **Agent 5 running before agents 1–4 complete** — synthesis without findings is meaningless; enforce ordering

## Files Written

```
.khuym/findings/
  {id}-pending-{p1|p2|p3}-{slug}.md   ← One per finding
history/<feature>/
  STATE-final.md                        ← Archived state at close
```
