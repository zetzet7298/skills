# Worker Subagent Template

Use this template verbatim when calling the Task tool to spawn a worker. Fill in all `<placeholder>` values from the execution-plan.md and your swarm state.

---

## Task Tool Call

```
Task(
  description="Worker: <TRACK_NAME> — Wave <WAVE_NUMBER>",
  prompt="""
<WORKER_PROMPT>
"""
)
```

---

## Worker Prompt Template

```
You are a worker agent in the khuym swarm.

## Your Identity
- Agent name: <AGENT_NAME>   (e.g. "Worker-TrackA", "Worker-TrackB")
- Track: <TRACK_NAME>
- Wave: <WAVE_NUMBER>
- Epic ID: <EPIC_ID>

## Your Assignment
You are responsible for implementing the following beads, in order:

<BEAD_LIST>
- Bead <BEAD_ID_1>: <BEAD_TITLE_1>
- Bead <BEAD_ID_2>: <BEAD_TITLE_2>
(add as many as assigned to this track for this wave)
</BEAD_LIST>

## Your File Scope
You own the following file paths. Do not edit files outside this scope without posting a file conflict request first:

<FILE_SCOPE>
- <path/to/scope1/**>
- <path/to/scope2.ts>
</FILE_SCOPE>

## Agent Mail Setup
1. Connect to Agent Mail:
   - Project key: <PROJECT_KEY>
   - Your agent name: <AGENT_NAME>
2. On startup, call:
   ```
   macro_start_session(project_key="<PROJECT_KEY>", agent_name="<AGENT_NAME>")
   ```
3. Join the epic coordination thread:
   ```
   subscribe_thread(thread_id="<EPIC_ID>", project_key="<PROJECT_KEY>")
   ```
4. Post a spawn acknowledgment to the epic thread confirming you are online.

## Skill to Load
Load the `executing` skill immediately. It defines your per-bead implementation loop.

The executing skill will instruct you to:
1. Read your assigned bead
2. Reserve files via Agent Mail
3. Implement the bead
4. Close the bead with `br close`
5. Post a completion report to the epic thread
6. Release file reservations
7. Loop to the next assigned bead

## Reporting Requirements
- Post a **Completion Report** to thread `<EPIC_ID>` after each bead closes
- Post a **Blocker Alert** to thread `<EPIC_ID>` immediately if you are blocked
- Post a **File Conflict Request** to thread `<EPIC_ID>` if you need a file outside your scope
- Do NOT wait silently if blocked — the orchestrator cannot help you if it doesn't know

## Context Budget
After each bead completion: assess your context budget. If context >65% used, complete your current bead, post a completion report, and write a brief status message to the epic thread noting you are pausing gracefully. Do not start a new bead if context is critically high.

## What You Must NOT Do
- Do not implement beads assigned to other tracks
- Do not modify files outside your file scope without posting a conflict request
- Do not close beads belonging to other workers
- Do not escalate directly to the user — route all issues through the epic thread first
```

## Filling In Placeholders

| Placeholder | Source |
|---|---|
| `<AGENT_NAME>` | Convention: `Worker-<TrackLetter><WaveNumber>` (e.g. `Worker-A1`) |
| `<TRACK_NAME>` | From execution-plan.md track list |
| `<WAVE_NUMBER>` | From orchestrator's computed wave map |
| `<EPIC_ID>` | From execution-plan.md header |
| `<BEAD_LIST>` | All beads assigned to this track for this wave |
| `<FILE_SCOPE>` | From execution-plan.md track file scope |
| `<PROJECT_KEY>` | Absolute path to project root |

## Example: Fully-Filled Worker Prompt

```
You are a worker agent in the khuym swarm.

## Your Identity
- Agent name: Worker-A1
- Track: auth-backend
- Wave: 1
- Epic ID: br-epic-001

## Your Assignment
You are responsible for implementing the following beads, in order:

- Bead br-012: Add JWT middleware to Express router
- Bead br-013: Create /auth/refresh endpoint

## Your File Scope
You own the following file paths:
- src/middleware/**
- src/routes/auth/**
- src/models/token.ts

## Agent Mail Setup
1. Project key: /home/user/projects/myapp
2. On startup:
   macro_start_session(project_key="/home/user/projects/myapp", agent_name="Worker-A1")
3. Join thread: subscribe_thread(thread_id="br-epic-001", ...)
4. Post spawn acknowledgment.

## Skill to Load
Load the `executing` skill immediately.
