# Dream Skill

This skill performs one manual consolidation pass. It updates durable learnings in place and keeps
the write surface narrow: `history/learnings/*.md`. It may propose critical promotions, but it must
never edit `history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` without explicit user approval.

## When To Use

Invoke when the user asks to run a dream pass, consolidate Codex-derived insights, refresh stale
learnings, or decide whether a new durable lesson should merge into an existing file or create new.

## Inputs

- Optional recurring override: days and/or sessions
- Optional explicit mode override: bootstrap or recurring
- Optional explicit scope narrowing from the user

## Process

Run these phases in order.

### Phase 1: Orient And Detect Run Mode

1. Read existing learnings files under `history/learnings/` (excluding `critical-patterns.md` content edits).
2. Detect dream provenance by scanning learnings frontmatter for `last_dream_consolidated_at`.
3. Choose mode:
 - `bootstrap`: if no learnings file carries `last_dream_consolidated_at`, or user explicitly requests full scan.
 - `recurring`: when provenance exists and no bootstrap override is requested.
4. If provenance signals conflict, ask one short clarification question before scanning.

### Phase 2: Select Codex Sources

Use source priority from `references/codex-source-policy.md`.

1. Primary source: `~/.codex/history.jsonl`.
2. Targeted fallback: `~/.codex/logs_1.sqlite` only to confirm a specific hypothesis.
3. Recurring defaults: last `7 days` and up to `20 sessions`, unless user override is provided.
4. Avoid telemetry dumping or exhaustive scans when recurring mode already has a bounded window.
5. In recurring mode, do not expand to full-history scans unless the user explicitly overrides scope.

### Phase 3: Extract Durable Candidates

Keep only reusable lessons, decisions, and stable facts. Drop transient execution noise, one-off
command spew, and ephemeral local-state details.

### Phase 4: Classify Each Candidate

Use `references/consolidation-rubric.md` and classify every candidate into exactly one branch:

- `clear match`: exactly one learning file clearly owns the same durable lesson
- `ambiguous`: two or more plausible owners, or ownership is uncertain
- `no match`: no existing learning file is a good owner
- `no durable signal`: candidate is not durable enough to retain

### Phase 5: Apply Outcome

- `clear match`:
 - Rewrite/merge only when exactly one owner is clear.
 - Preserve durability and remove contradicted details.
 - Update or set `last_dream_consolidated_at` in the learning file frontmatter.
- `ambiguous`:
 - Pause and show candidate learnings files with reasons.
 - Present explicit labeled options in plain chat:
   - `merge → <target file A>`
   - `merge → <target file B>` (if another target is plausible)
   - `create new`
   - `skip`
 - Do not silently choose a target file.
- `no match`:
 - Create a new dated learnings file under `history/learnings/`.
 - Write `last_dream_consolidated_at` in frontmatter.
- `no durable signal`:
 - Perform no learnings write for that candidate.

### Phase 6: Critical Promotion Gate

If a candidate should be promoted, propose the promotion in the run summary and request explicit
approval first. Never auto-edit `history/learnings/critical-patterns.md`.

### Phase 7: Report Summary

Return a concise run summary with:
- Mode used (`bootstrap` or `recurring`)
- Source window used (including override if any)
- Files rewritten, files created, and skipped candidates
- Any pending ambiguous decisions or critical-pattern approvals

## Hard Rules

- Rewrite is the narrow path: only when exactly one owner is clear.
- Ambiguous matching requires candidate-specific options with explicit target file naming.
- Do not edit `critical-patterns.md` without explicit approval.
- If no durable signal exists, write nothing for that candidate.
- Do not silently guess first-run status; ask one clarification question when provenance is conflicting.
- Do not run unbounded `.codex` scans during recurring mode without explicit user override.
